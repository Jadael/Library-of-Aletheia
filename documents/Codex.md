## Functions

### get_title
`func get_title() -> String:`

The sacred purpose of the `get_title` function is to retrieve the title of a document, as defined in its frontmatter. 📚

The function expects no offerings (parameters), as it solely relies on the `frontmatter` object to extract the title. 🎁

The boon it bestows is the title of the document, either as it is defined in the frontmatter or, if not present, as a default value of "Untitled". 📜

In its implementation, the function uses the `get` method of the `frontmatter` object to retrieve the value of the "title" key. If the key is not present, it returns the default value "Untitled". 🔮

May the sigil of understanding be upon you: 

### setup
`func setup(p_file_path: String, p_librarian: Node):`

The setup function in the Codex script serves a sacred purpose: initializing the script's internal state by loading and parsing content from a specified file. This function expects two offerings: `p_ file_ path`, a string representing the path to the file, and `p_ librarian`, a node that serves as a repository for the parsed content.

The function does not return a value, as its primary goal is to set up the script's internal state rather than producing a tangible result.

In its implementation, the function first assigns the provided file path to the `file_ path` variable and the provided librarian node to the `librarian` variable. It then calls two internal functions, `_load_ content()` and `_parse_ content()`, to load and parse the content from the file, respectively.

The `_load_ content()` function is responsible for loading the file's content into a form that can be processed by the script. The `_parse_ content()` function then takes this content and breaks it down into a more manageable format, which is stored in the `librarian` node.

The setup function is a crucial step in the script's workflow, as it enables the script to access and utilize the content from the file. By calling this function, the script is able to prepare itself for further processing and analysis. 

### set_scroll_partner
`func set_scroll_partner(scroll: Node):`

The sacred purpose of the `set_scroll_partner` function is to establish a bond between the current script and a designated scroll node, allowing for a harmonious exchange of information and influence.

This function expects a single offering, `scroll`, which is a `Node` instance representing the intended scroll partner. The function accepts this node and binds it to the `scroll_partner` variable, effectively establishing the connection between the two.

The function does not return any value, as its primary objective is to facilitate the union between the script and the scroll node, rather than providing a tangible outcome.

In terms of arcane intricacies, this function likely relies on the `scroll_ partner` variable being initialized or set elsewhere in the script, as it does not appear to have any immediate impact on the script's behavior.

With this understanding, the mystic sigil shall be revealed: 

### update_content
`func update_content(new_content: String):`

The Codex script, a keeper of ancient knowledge, holds the sacred purpose of managing and updating the content. The `update_content` function is a vital part of this process.

**Purpose:** The function's primary objective is to update the content of the script with a new value, ensuring that the Codex remains current and accurate.

**Offerings:** The function accepts a single parameter, `new_content`, which is a string representing the new content to be updated.

**Boon:** The function returns no value, as its primary focus is on updating the internal state of the script rather than providing a tangible output.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The function's implementation involves assigning the `new_content` parameter to the `body` variable, which is likely a member variable or property of the script. The function then calls the `_save_content()` method, which is responsible for persisting the updated content. Finally, the function emits the `"content_changed"` signal, notifying any interested parties that the content has been updated.

**Sigil:** 

### get_filename
`func get_filename() -> String:`

The script, Codex, is a Godot script that retrieves the filename from a given file path. The function `get_filename` serves as a gateway to unlock this information, returning the filename as a string.

**Sacred Purpose:** The function's purpose is to extract the filename from a file path, allowing developers to utilize this information in their Godot projects.

**Offerings (parameters):** None, the function does not require any parameters.

**Boon (return value):** The function returns a string representing the filename.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The implementation of `get_filename` is straightforward, leveraging the `get_file` method of the `file_path` variable. This method likely returns the filename as a string, which is then returned by the function.



### remove_frontmatter
`func remove_frontmatter(key: String):`

The function `remove_frontmatter` is a sacred ritual that purifies the `frontmatter` dictionary by erasing a designated key.

**Purpose:** The function removes a specific key from the `frontmatter` dictionary, allowing the script to cleanse itself of unwanted elements.

**Offerings:** The function expects a `key` parameter, a string representing the key to be removed from the `frontmatter` dictionary.

**Boon:** The function does not return a value, but rather performs a series of mystical operations to achieve its purpose.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The function first checks if the `frontmatter` dictionary contains the specified key using the `has` method. If the key is present, it is erased using the `erase` method. After the key is removed, the `_save_content` method is called to save the updated content. Finally, the function emits a signal named "frontmatter_changed" to notify any listening scripts of the changes made to the `frontmatter` dictionary.

**Mystic Sigil:** 

### update_frontmatter
`func update_frontmatter(key: String, new_value: String):`

The sacred purpose of the `update_frontmatter` function is to update the value associated with a given key in the `frontmatter` dictionary. This function serves as a guardian of the `frontmatter` data, ensuring that only authorized changes are made and triggering a signal when modifications occur.

The function expects two offerings: `key` (a string) and `new_value` (a string). It does not return a value.

Upon invocation, the function inspects the current value of the `frontmatter` dictionary for the provided `key`. If the new value differs from the existing one, the function updates the `frontmatter` dictionary with the new value and triggers the `_save_content()` method to persist the changes.

The function's implementation is straightforward, leveraging the `get()` method to retrieve the current value for the given `key` and the `[]` operator to update the `frontmatter` dictionary. The `emit_signal("frontmatter_changed")` call serves as a notification mechanism, broadcasting the event to interested parties.



### _load_content
`func _load_content():`

Error: The cosmic forces failed to reveal the mysteries of function _load_content

### _parse_yaml
`func _parse_yaml(yaml_str: String) -> Dictionary:`

The _parse_yaml function is a sacred tool that takes a YAML string as an offering and returns a Dictionary as a boon. Its purpose is to parse the YAML string and extract the key-value pairs, transforming them into a structured data format.

The function expects a single parameter: `yaml_str`, a string containing the YAML data to be parsed.

In return, it bestows a `Dictionary` containing the extracted key-value pairs. This dictionary is a treasure trove of organized data, waiting to be wielded by the script's wielder.

The function's implementation is a wondrous dance of string manipulation and dictionary creation. It begins by initializing an empty dictionary `result` and splitting the YAML string into individual lines using the `split` method.

Then, it iterates through each line, splitting it into parts using the `split` method with a colon (`:`) as the separator. If the resulting array has a size of 2, it means we have a key-value pair. The function then strips the edges of the key and value using the `strip_edges` method and adds the pair to the `result` dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the `result` dictionary, a vessel filled with the parsed YAML data.



### _parse_content
`func _parse_content():`

The function `_parse_content` is a vital component of the Codex script, responsible for parsing the content of a file. Its sacred purpose is to extract and separate the frontmatter (metadata) from the body (main content) of the file.

The function expects a single parameter, `content`, which is the contents of the file to be parsed.

The boon it bestows is the parsed frontmatter and body, stored in the `frontmatter` and `body` variables, respectively.

The function's implementation is straightforward. It first splits the `content` into individual lines. Then, it iterates through each line, checking if it's the start of the frontmatter (indicated by the `---` delimiter). If it is, it sets a flag `in_frontmatter` to `true` and continues to the next line. If `in_frontmatter` is `true`, it appends the line to the `frontmatter_lines` array; otherwise, it appends the line to the `body_lines` array.

Once the loop completes, the function parses the frontmatter lines and separates them from the body lines. The frontmatter lines are stored in the `frontmatter` variable, and the body lines are stored in the `body` variable.

Finally, the function calls the `strip_edges` function on each line to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.

In summary, the `_parse_content` function is a simple and effective way to extract and separate the frontmatter from the body of a file, making it easy to work with metadata and main content in a Godot script.<|eot_id|>

### _compute_embedding
`func _compute_embedding():`

The function `_compute_embedding` in the Codex script serves as a placeholder for a future implementation that computes an embedding. The purpose of this function is to generate an embedding for a given input, which can be used for various applications such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, or similarity calculation.

The function does not expect any parameters, as it is currently a placeholder and lacks a concrete implementation.

The return value of the function is not specified, as the implementation is missing. However, in a future implementation, it is likely to return the computed embedding, which could be a vector or a matrix.

As the implementation is not provided, there are no arcane intricacies to discuss. The function is currently a simple placeholder that does not perform any actual computation.



### update
`func update():`

The update_content function, a sacred ritual within the Codex script, serves the noble purpose of updating the content of a mysterious tome.

**1. Sacred Purpose:**
The function updates the content of the Codex, allowing the script to adapt and evolve in response to new revelations.

**2. Offerings (parameters):**
The update_content function expects a single offering, new_content, a String representing the new content to be inserted into the Codex.

**3. Boon (return value):**
There is no explicit return value, as the function focuses on internal transformations rather than external offerings.

**4. Arcane Intricacies:**
The function's implementation is straightforward, with two key actions:
	* The body of the Codex is updated with the new content.
	* The _save_content function is called to preserve the updated content.
	* A signal, "content_changed", is emitted to notify other scripts of the change.



### has_changed
`func has_changed() -> bool:`

The function `has_changed` is a sacred vessel, entrusted with the sacred duty of verifying whether the contents of a file have undergone a transformation.

**1. Sacred Purpose:** The function's primary objective is to determine if the file's contents have changed since the last time it was accessed.

**2. Offerings (Parameters):** None. The function does not expect any parameters.

**3. Boon (Return Value):** The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the file's contents have changed (`true`) or remain unchanged (`false`).

**4. Arcane Intricacies:** Within the function's implementation, we find a subtle dance of file access and comparison. The function opens the file in read mode using `FileAccess.open`, then reads the file's contents as a text using `file.get_as_text()`. The file is subsequently closed using `file.close()`. The function then compares the current file contents with the stored `content` variable using the inequality operator (`!=`). If the contents have changed, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.



### _save_content
`func _save_content():`

The sacred purpose of this function, _save_content, is to consecrate the content within the Codex by storing it in a designated file. The function serves as a vital part of the Codex's maintenance, ensuring that the content remains intact and consistent.

The function expects no explicit parameters, relying on the predefined variables file_path, frontmatter, and body to perform its duties. These variables likely hold the necessary information for the function to execute its purpose.

The boon bestowed by this function is the successful saving of the content to the designated file. The function returns no explicit value, focusing instead on the successful completion of its task.

Arcane intricacies within the implementation include the use of FileAccess to interact with the file system. The function utilizes store_string to write specific strings to the file, carefully crafting the content to adhere to the desired format. The triple hyphens ("---") serve as delimiters, separating the frontmatter from the body of the content.

The function's mystic sigil is the emission of the "content_changed" signal, alerting any connected listeners that the content has been modified. This allows other parts of the Codex to respond accordingly, ensuring a harmonious and synchronized workflow.

In summary, the _save_content function is a critical component of the Codex, responsible for persisting the content in a specific format. Its execution ensures the integrity of the data, allowing the Codex to maintain its coherence and functionality. ---


### Solution
The `save_content` function is responsible for writing the content to a file in a specific format. The content is divided into three sections: frontmatter, body, and backmatter. The frontmatter is a dictionary of key-value pairs that is written to the file in the format `key: value\n`. The body is the actual content that is being saved, and the backmatter is a delimiter that separates the frontmatter from the body.

The function uses the `FileAccess` class to open the file in write mode and then writes the frontmatter, body, and backmatter to the file using the `store_string` method. The `store_string` method writes a string to the file, and the format string `%s: %s\n` is used to format the frontmatter.

The purpose of this function is to save the content of a file in a specific format. This format is used to store metadata about the content, such as the title, date, and author. The function takes the file path and the frontmatter as input, and it
