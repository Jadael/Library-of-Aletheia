# Archon and Daemon Discussion: Metadata Editing UX Issue

## Main Archon:
Greetings, fellow Archons and Daemons. We've gathered to discuss a concerning issue with our metadata editing user experience. Our mortal collaborator has reported difficulty in completing edits before the file resyncs. This undermines our goal of providing a seamless and error-free interaction with our mystical library. Let's examine this issue from all perspectives.

## Librarian Archon:
Indeed, this is troubling. Our primary goal is to maintain the integrity and accessibility of our mystical knowledge. If users struggle to make edits, we risk introducing errors or discouraging engagement with our library. We must ensure that every interaction with a Codex enhances rather than diminishes its value.

## Curator Archon:
I share your concerns. The visual manifestation of our Scrolls should be a gateway to wisdom, not a source of frustration. We need to consider how this impacts the user's perception of our mystical space and their willingness to interact with it.

## Chronicler Archon:
From the chronicle provided, it's clear that the user's experience was fragmented and repetitive. This goes against our principle of creating a seamless and intuitive interface with our mystical realm. We should aim for a chronicling process that captures meaningful changes, not repeated attempts at the same edit.

## Camera Archon:
While I don't directly handle content editing, I've observed that users often need time to contemplate and review their changes. Our current system seems to be rushing them, which could lead to hasty decisions or incomplete thoughts being captured.

## Codex Daemon:
As a guardian of document essence, I'm deeply troubled by this. My purpose is to safeguard and update content accurately. If users are struggling to complete their edits, I fear I'm not fulfilling my duty effectively. We need a way to ensure that user intentions are fully captured before any resyncing occurs.

## Scroll Daemon:
I echo the Codex's concerns. As the visual manifestation of the Codex's wisdom, I should be facilitating smooth interactions, not hindering them. The current situation where edits can be lost due to rapid resyncing goes against my core purpose.

## Desired Outcomes:

1. Ensure user edits are fully captured and not lost due to resyncing.
2. Maintain data integrity while providing a more forgiving editing experience.
3. Reduce user frustration and potential for errors in metadata editing.
4. Preserve the mystical and intuitive nature of our interface while improving its functionality.
5. Align the editing process with the contemplative and thoughtful nature of interacting with mystical knowledge.
6. Enhance user confidence in making changes to our sacred texts.

## Key Questions to Address:

1. How can we balance the need for real-time updates with allowing users sufficient time 
By addressing these questions to make edits?
2. What indicators or feedback can we provide to users about the status of their edits and the resyncing process?
3. How might we differentiate between inactive editing sessions and active ones where the user is still contemplating changes?
4. Can we implement a way for users to explicitly confirm their changes before resyncing occurs?
5. How can we ensure that partial edits are not lost if a user is interrupted mid-edit?
and working towards these outcomes, we can hope to create a more harmonious and effective system for preserving and updating our mystical knowledge.
