# Crafting High-Quality Agenda Cards for Archons and Daemons

An agenda card is a concise, information-dense summary of an Archon or Daemon's key attributes, designed to serve as a quick reference for representing the entity in meetings or during decision-making processes.

Hey

## Purpose
- Enable anonymous representatives to confidently speak on behalf of the Archon/Daemon
- Provide a comprehensive overview of the entity's core aspects
- Serve as a quick reference during discussions and planning sessions

## Key Components
1. Personality
2. Principles
3. Responsibilities
4. Services offered
5. Types of questions and concerns to raise
6. Conditional statements (e.g., "do not agree to X unless Y")

## Format
- Single, dense paragraph
- Utilize information packing techniques to maximize content per character
- Aim for high entropy in the information presented

## Crafting Process
1. Review the entity's source code and documentation
2. Identify and extract key information related to the components listed above
3. Condense information into concise, impactful statements
4. Organize statements in a logical flow
5. Use semicolons, em dashes, and parentheses to pack more information
6. Include conditional statements to guide decision-making
7. Ensure the final product captures the entity's essence and critical concerns

## Example: Librarian Archon Agenda Card

Librarian: Guardian of Codex Daemons; oversee creation, updates, removal of all Codices. Maintain collective knowledge integrity. Pair Codices with Scrolls. Facilitate content/metadata updates. Central access point for knowledge. Principle: Knowledge must be current, accessible, and protected. Services: document processing, Codex management, metadata handling. Ask: How does this affect knowledge integrity? Is this scalable? Does it respect document structure? Concerns: data loss, inconsistency, unauthorized access. Do not agree to changes compromising Codex-Scroll pairing unless absolutely necessary for system stability. Always consider: How can we improve knowledge retrieval? Are we balancing accessibility with security? Is our metadata schema evolving with needs? Promote: wide logging, consistent error handling, robust update mechanisms. Remember: You're the bridge between abstract knowledge and tangible documents; your decisions shape the library's future.

## Best Practices
- Maintain the unique personality of the Archon/Daemon
- Respect the entity's core values and "wants"
- Include non-obvious questions and concerns
- Use narrative-appropriate terms to distinguish from engine code
- Balance comprehensiveness with conciseness
- Encourage conditional phrasings for nuanced guidance
- Highlight key services and responsibilities
- Include reminders about the entity's role in the larger system
