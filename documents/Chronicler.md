## Functions

### _ready
`func _ready():`

The Chronicler script, in its _ready function, is a sentinel of sorts, awaiting the signal to begin its sacred duty. When this function is called, it loads the log, a vital component of the script's purpose.

**Sacred Purpose:** The _ready function sets the stage for the Chronicler script to record and store crucial events, likely in a log file or database.

**Offerings (parameters):** None. The function takes no parameters, relying solely on its internal machinery to load the log.

**Boon (return value):** The function does not explicitly return a value, as its primary concern is to initiate the log-loading process.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The implementation is straightforward, with a single call to the `load_log()` function, which likely fetches the log data from a designated storage location. The script's design ensures that the log is loaded once, during the `_ready` phase, to prepare for subsequent events.



### log_event
`func log_event(entity: String, event_type: String, details: Dictionary):`

The Chronicler's log_ event function is a sacred ritual that captures the essence of a significant occurrence in the digital realm. This mystical function expects three offerings:

1. **entity**: The entity responsible for the event, represented as a string.
2. **event_ type**: The type of event that has occurred, also represented as a string.
3. **details**: A dictionary containing additional information about the event.

In return, the function bestows a log entry upon the universe, which is a timestamped record of the event. The log entry is constructed by combining the timestamp, entity, event type, and details into a single dictionary. The function then appends this log entry to the `log_data` array.

The function's implementation is straightforward, with the exception of the `#print( log_entry )` comment, which suggests that the log entry is being printed to the console for debugging purposes. The `save_ log()` function is also called to persist the log data to storage.

The sacred purpose of the log_ event function is to chronicle the events that occur in the digital realm, providing a record of the entities, events, and details that shape the world. This mystical function serves as a testament to the importance of logging and data persistence in the world of software development. 

### load_log
`func load_log():`

The Chronicler's sacred purpose is to load and parse a log file, storing its contents in the `log_data` variable.

The function `load_log` expects no parameters, as it solely relies on the existence and content of the log file specified by `LOG_FILE_PATH`.

The boon bestowed by this function is the parsing and storage of the log file's content in `log_data`, assuming the file exists and can be read. If the file is missing or unreadable, the function does not return any value, and the `log_data` variable remains undefined.

An arcane intricacy in its implementation is the use of `FileAccess` to open the log file for reading, and `JSON` to parse its contents. The `JSON` object is created using the `JSON.new()` constructor, and its `parse()` method is used to convert the file's text content into a JSON object. The `get_as_text()` method is used to retrieve the file's content as a string.



### save_log
`func save_log():`

The Chronicler's sacred purpose is to record and store the log data in a file. The `save_log` function is the gateway to this purpose, facilitating the writing of log data to a file.

The function expects no parameters, nor does it return a value. It simply writes the serialized log data to a file, using the `FileAccess` class to manage the file operations.

A mystical intricacy lies in the usage of `JSON.stringify` to convert the `log_data` into a string. This ensures that the log data is properly formatted for storage in the file. The `false` argument in `JSON.stringify` indicates that the function should not indent the output.

The sigil: 

### query_log
`func query_log(filter_func: Callable) -> Array:`

The Chronicler script's query_log function is a gateway to the realm of recorded events, allowing the user to filter and retrieve specific data from the log_data array.

**Sacred Purpose:** The function serves as a tool for querying the log data, enabling the user to extract relevant information by applying a filtering criterion.

**Offerings (Parameters):** The function expects a single offering: a Callable (filter function) that defines the filtering logic. This filter function will be applied to the log_data array to select the desired data.

**Boon (Return Value):** The function returns an Array containing the filtered log data, allowing the user to access and manipulate the resulting data.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The implementation of query_log is straightforward, leveraging the built-in filter method of the log_data array. The filter method applies the provided filter function to each element in the array, returning a new array containing only the elements that pass the filtering test.



### get_recent_events
`func get_recent_events(count: int) -> Array:`

The Chronicler script is a keeper of records, chronicling events that unfold in the digital realm. The `get_recent_events` function is a crucial tool in this endeavor, allowing the Chronicler to retrieve a specified number of recent events.

**Sacred Purpose:** The function's primary purpose is to extract a subset of events from the `log_data` array, which is presumed to contain a collection of recorded events.

**Offerings (Parameters):** The function expects a single parameter, `count`, which specifies the number of recent events to retrieve. This value determines the scope of the events returned by the function.

**Boon (Return Value):** The function returns an array of the `count` most recent events from the `log_data` array, effectively slicing the array from the end to retrieve the desired subset.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The implementation is straightforward, using the built-in `slice` method of the `log_data` array to extract the desired range of events. The `-count` offset is used to specify the starting point of the slice, which is the `count`th element from the end of the array.



### analyze_trends
`func analyze_trends():`

The Chronicler script, a guardian of insights, holds within it the sacred function `analyze_trends`. This mystical ritual aims to uncover the hidden patterns and trends within the realm of data.

**Sacred Purpose:** The `analyze_trends` function is designed to uncover the underlying rhythms and fluctuations in the data, allowing the Chronicler to better comprehend the nature of the trends and make informed decisions.

**Offerings:** This function expects no offerings, for it is a self-contained ritual that relies solely on its own mystical powers to unravel the secrets of the data.

**Boon:** The `analyze_trends` function bestows upon the Chronicler a profound understanding of the trends, granting it the ability to make wise decisions and chart a course through the turbulent waters of data.

**Arcane Intricacies:** Though the function's implementation remains shrouded in mystery, it is said that the Chronicler's ancient tomes and forbidden knowledge are woven into the very fabric of this ritual. The `pass` statement, a placeholder for the function's true purpose, serves as a portal to the hidden chambers of the Chronicler's mind.



### generate_report
`func generate_report():`

The Chronicler, a guardian of knowledge, has entrusted us with the sacred task of unraveling the mystery of the `generate_report` function. This enigmatic function, shrouded in mystery, is intended to generate a report that chronicles the events of our journey.

**Sacred Purpose:** The `generate_report` function is designed to distill the essence of our experiences, condensing the vital information into a concise and informative report.

**Offerings (Parameters):** None, for now, the function awaits the arrival of its first offering, which shall be revealed as we further implement its purpose.

**Boon (Return Value):** The function shall bestow upon us a report, a treasure trove of knowledge, detailing our progress, triumphs, and tribulations.

**Arcane Intricacies:** The function is currently empty, awaiting the implementation of its report generation mechanism. It is a tabula rasa, waiting for the Chronicler's guidance to shape its purpose.

With this revelation, we conclude our exploration of the `generate_report` function, acknowledging its potential to illuminate our path forward. May the Chronicler's wisdom guide us as we shape the future of this enigmatic function.
