# The Chronicler's Guide to Exemplary Logging Practices

Greetings, fellow Archons and Daemons of our mystical realm. I, the Chronicler, keeper of our collective memory, present to you this guide on the art of logging. By following these practices, you shall contribute to the rich tapestry of our shared history, enabling us to better understand, debug, and improve our mystical ecosystem.

## 1. Log Generously, But Purposefully

- Record all significant events, state changes, and decisions.
- Don't shy away from logging - in our realm, there's no such thing as too much information.
- However, ensure each log has a purpose. Ask yourself: "Will this log entry be useful for understanding system behavior, debugging, or analysis?"

## 2. Provide Rich Context

- Include all relevant details in your log entries.
- Use the 'details' dictionary to add as much context as possible.
- Include identifiers (e.g., Codex IDs, Scroll IDs) to allow for easy tracing and correlation of events.

Example:
```gdscript
Chronicler.log_event("Librarian", "codex_updated", {
    "codex_id": codex.get_instance_id(),
    "title": codex.get_title(),
    "changes": ["content", "metadata"],
    "user_id": current_user.id
})
```

## 3. Use Consistent Event Types

- Develop a consistent vocabulary for event types across all Archons and Daemons.
- Use clear, descriptive event types that convey the nature of the event at a glance.

Common event types might include:
- initialized
- created
- updated
- deleted
- error
- warning
- interaction

## 4. Log the Unexpected

- Always log errors, exceptions, and unexpected behaviors.
- Include stack traces and relevant variable states when logging errors.

## 5. Use Structured Logging

- Leverage the structured nature of our logging system.
- Avoid embedding important information in free-text fields; use the 'details' dictionary instead.

Instead of:
```gdscript
Chronicler.log_event("Curator", "error", {"message": "Failed to place scroll at position (100, 200)"})
```

Do:
```gdscript
Chronicler.log_event("Curator", "scroll_placement_failed", {
    "scroll_id": scroll.get_instance_id(),
    "attempted_position": Vector2(100, 200),
    "reason": "position_occupied"
})
```

## 6. Log State Transitions

- Record when your internal state changes, especially for Archons.
- Include both the previous and new state in your log entry.

## 7. Use Appropriate Granularity

- For complex operations, consider logging at multiple levels of granularity.
- Log at the start and end of significant processes, as well as important milestones in between.

## 8. Be Mindful of Privacy and Security

- Do not log sensitive information (e.g., user passwords, API keys).
- If you must log sensitive data for debugging purposes, ensure it's appropriately masked or encrypted.

## 9. Log User Actions

- Record significant user interactions and decisions.
- This helps in understanding user behavior and debugging user-reported issues.

## 10. Use Consistent Naming Conventions

- Use consistent names for entities, attributes, and event types across all logs.
- This consistency will make querying and analyzing logs much easier.

## 11. Log Performance Metrics

- Record the duration of important operations.
- Log resource usage when relevant (e.g., memory usage, number of Codices loaded).

Example:
```gdscript
var start_time = Time.get_ticks_msec()
# ... perform operation ...
var duration = Time.get_ticks_msec() - start_time
Chronicler.log_event("Librarian", "bulk_codex_processing_completed", {
    "num_codices": processed_codices.size(),
    "duration_ms": duration,
    "avg_time_per_codex": duration / processed_codices.size()
})
```

## 12. Be Future-Proof

- When in doubt, log it. You never know what information might be useful in the future.
- Our logging system is flexible, so don't hesitate to add new types of information to your logs.

Remember, dear Archons and Daemons, that through your diligent logging, you contribute to the collective wisdom of our realm. Your logs are not mere records, but the very threads that weave the tapestry of our shared existence. Log well, and may your events be forever chronicled in the annals of our mystical library.
