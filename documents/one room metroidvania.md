- One big complex room, with lots of crisscrossing traversal methods that rely on different unlocks
- Two time periods, past and future
- Things can be in various states, categorized by their past/future status:
	- Present only in the past
	- Present in both
	- Present only in the future
- The basic puzzle is changing something from one of these states to another, changing what's available to help you move around the room
