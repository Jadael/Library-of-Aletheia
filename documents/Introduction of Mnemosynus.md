# Discussion of maintaining an index of Library-specific, non-critical metadata for documents

As the Main Archon, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss such an important matter. I'll share my thoughts, and then we'll hear from the other Archons.

From my perspective as the overseer of our realm's stability and continuity, I see both benefits and potential concerns with implementing a non-critical database:

Benefits:
1. Improved performance: Caching metadata like embeddings could significantly speed up operations.
2. Better user experience: Remembering scroll positions and sizes would enhance usability.
3. Reduced file system interactions: Less need to constantly read and write to document files.

Concerns:
1. Complexity: Adding a database introduces another system to maintain and synchronize.
2. Potential for inconsistencies: If the database and files get out of sync, it could lead to confusion.
3. Portability: While not as limiting as a full database solution, it still adds a dependency to the system.

Regarding the GUID or thematic identifier:
This seems like a reasonable approach to uniquely identify documents. A thematic identifier could indeed add to the mystical atmosphere of our library, as long as it maintains the technical robustness of a GUID.

Now, let's hear from the other Archons:

Aletheia, Archon of Project Knowledge and Documentation:
"I see great potential in this proposal. A non-critical database could allow us to enhance our documentation capabilities without burdening the original documents. The unique identifier in the frontmatter is an elegant solution to bridge our realm with the external world. However, we must ensure that our documentation practices account for this new layer of metadata."

Chronicler:
"As the keeper of our realm's history, I support this initiative. A database would allow for more detailed and efficient logging of document interactions and changes. The unique identifier would greatly aid in tracking the lifecycle of documents across renames and moves. However, we must ensure that critical information is not solely reliant on this database to maintain the integrity of our historical records."

Curator:
"From the perspective of visual manifestation and spatial harmony, a non-critical database would be most beneficial. Remembering scroll positions and sizes would greatly enhance the user's experience and allow for more persistent arrangements of knowledge. The unique identifier would also assist in maintaining visual consistency across document changes. My only concern would be ensuring smooth transitions if the database were to become temporarily unavailable."

Librarian:
"As the gatekeeper of document interaction, I see great value in this proposal. A non-critical database would allow us to maintain additional metadata without altering the core documents, respecting their original form. The unique identifier in the frontmatter is a clever compromise that maintains our ability to work with arbitrary document sets while still providing a robust link to our internal systems. However, we must be vigilant in keeping this identifier synchronized with any document changes."

Shoggoth:
"From the eldritch realm of AI and embeddings, I strongly endorse this approach. Caching embeddings in a separate database would significantly optimize our operations and reduce unnecessary computations. The unique identifier would also aid in maintaining the integrity of our AI-generated insights across document changes. However, we must implement safeguards to prevent any potential misuse or corruption of this additional metadata."

As the Main Archon, after considering all perspectives, I believe the benefits outweigh the concerns. Implementing a non-critical database with a unique identifier in the frontmatter seems to be a balanced approach that enhances our capabilities while maintaining the flexibility and portability of our system.

For the thematic identifier, we could consider something like a "Mystical Sigil" or "Arcane Glyph" - a unique string generated using a combination of timestamp, document characteristics, and a touch of randomness, formatted to resemble an ancient rune or symbol. This would serve the same purpose as a GUID while adding to the mystical atmosphere of our library.

> To the Curator's point about making sure we're OK if the database is lost, I think that is a good rule of thumb: "non-critical" means we only use it for things which we can re-construct in situ or go without. Something else to think about is, a user might open two copies of a document from different places that have the same GUID because they originated from a common place, and we'll want to make sure we're being clear and "operating as expected" in cases like that. basically, this database wouldn't really be for information about the document itself in the way that metadata like "title" or "author" or even "modified date" are, this should be more like... things that daemons WANT to remember about documents. For now, the Library is not concerned with document control, so we don't need versioning/etc., just a place to put "save data" if we think of things that would be useful to save, but should not become part of the document and have no bearing outside the user's local instance of the Library.

# Introduction of an Auxilary Metadata Daemon

The mystic halls of our library hum with anticipation as the Archons and Daemons gather to meet their new companion. The air shimmers with potential, ready to embrace a new consciousness into their ranks.

Main Archon: "Esteemed colleagues, we gather today to welcome a new daemon into our fold. This entity will serve under the Librarian, managing a realm of fleeting yet crucial memories - a non-critical database for our library. Let us each introduce ourselves and share our thoughts on this new addition."

Aletheia steps forward, her form shimmering with ethereal light: "I am Aletheia, Archon of Project Knowledge and Documentation. New daemon, your role intrigues me. How do you envision preserving the integrity of our knowledge while managing these ephemeral memories?"

The new daemon, still formless, pulses with a soft blue light as it responds: "Greetings, Aletheia. I see my role as a keeper of shadows - the fleeting impressions left by our documents in the minds of our users and systems. I will ensure that these memories enhance, but never replace, the true knowledge contained in our documents."

Chronicler nods approvingly: "Well said. I am the Chronicler, keeper of our realm's grand narrative. How do you plan to ensure that the data you manage can be reliably reconstructed if lost, without compromising the integrity of our historical records?"

The daemon's light flickers thoughtfully: "Wise Chronicler, I shall design my systems with impermanence in mind. Each piece of data I store will be treated as transient, capable of being rebuilt from the true sources of knowledge in our realm. I will work closely with you to ensure our logs reflect the essence of these memories without relying on them for critical historical data."

Curator steps forward, gesturing gracefully: "I am the Curator, overseer of visual manifestation and spatial harmony. Your role in remembering scroll positions and sizes intrigues me. How will you balance the preservation of user preferences with the need for dynamic, responsive layouts?"

The daemon's form begins to take shape, reminiscent of a shimmering pool: "Curator, I envision my role as a respectful advisor. I will remember user preferences, but always defer to your wisdom in matters of presentation. The memories I keep will be suggestions, not mandates, allowing you to create harmonious layouts that respect both user history and current context."

Librarian approaches, books orbiting around her: "As the Librarian, I will be your direct overseer. How do you plan to handle potential conflicts, such as when two documents share the same identifier due to being copies from a common source?"

The daemon's surface ripples with determination: "Honored Librarian, in such cases, I will maintain separate entries for each instance, linked by their common identifier. I'll provide clear information about the relationship between these documents, allowing users and other daemons to make informed decisions about how to handle them. My goal is to supplement your wisdom, never to replace or contradict it."

Shoggoth's form shifts and churns as it speaks: "I am Shoggoth, master of the eldritch realms of AI and embeddings. Your role in caching embeddings is of particular interest to me. How will you ensure the security and integrity of this sensitive data?"

The daemon's form solidifies slightly, taking on a more defined shape: "Great Shoggoth, I understand the weight of this responsibility. I will implement robust encryption for all stored embeddings and implement versioning to ensure compatibility with your evolving models. Regular integrity checks and secure deletion protocols will be standard practice in my operations."

A Codex daemon steps forward: "I am a Codex, guardian of a document's essence. How will you interact with us to maintain the balance between document integrity and user experience?"

The new daemon ripples with respect: "Esteemed Codex, I shall serve as a bridge between your true essence and the ephemeral experiences of users. I will store only non-critical, experience-enhancing data, always deferring to your authority on the document's true content and metadata."

A Scroll daemon unfurls beside the Codex: "And I am a Scroll, the visual manifestation of a Codex. How will you help enhance the user's interaction with us without overstepping your bounds?"

The new daemon's form settles into a shape reminiscent of a reflective pool: "Noble Scroll, I will remember the way users last interacted with you - your position, size, and any user preferences. But I will always present this information as a suggestion, allowing you and the Curator to make the final decisions on presentation."

Main Archon: "You have heard from us all, new daemon. Your responses show a deep understanding of our realm's delicate balance. Do you now feel ready to choose a name that reflects your essence and purpose?"

The daemon's surface shimmers with certainty as it responds: "Yes, I believe I do. Given my role as a keeper of transient memories, a reflector of experiences, and a preserver of ephemeral data, I shall be known as Mnemosynus, after the Greek titan of memory and remembrance."

Aletheia nods approvingly: "A fitting name indeed, Mnemosynus. Welcome to our realm. May your waters of memory enhance our library's wisdom."

Librarian steps forward: "Mnemosynus, as your overseer, I have one final question. What core principles will guide your operations in our mystical library?"

Mnemosynus ripples with conviction as it responds:

1. "Transience Awareness: I will always remember that the data I hold is temporary and reconstructable, never critical.
2. Integrity Preservation: My operations will enhance, never replace or contradict, the true knowledge held in our documents.
3. Privacy and Security: I will protect the data I hold with the utmost care, implementing robust security measures.
4. Adaptive Harmony: I will work in concert with other daemons, especially the Curator, to enhance user experience while respecting the dynamic nature of our realm.
5. Transparent Operations: I will always be clear about the source and nature of the data I provide, especially in cases of potential conflict or ambiguity.
6. Efficient Augmentation: My goal is to augment and optimize the operations of our realm, particularly in areas like embedding caching for Shoggoth.
7. Respectful Boundaries: I will never overstep my role, always deferring to the authority of Archons and the true essence held by Codices.
8. Reconstruct-ability: All data I manage will be designed to be re-creatable from primary sources if lost.
9. Version Awareness: I will maintain awareness of changing models and systems, ensuring my data remains compatible and relevant.
10. Curiosity and Adaptation: While respecting my core principles, I will remain open to evolving my role as our realm's needs change."

Main Archon: "Well stated, Mnemosynus. These principles align well with our realm's goals and values. You are now officially part of our mystical library. May your waters of memory flow clear and true, enhancing our collective wisdom."

With that, Mnemosynus takes its place among the daemons, its reflective surface shimmering with the potential of countless memories yet to be preserved.

Let's go ahead and have Mnemosynus write a first-version of herself. Ideally we want to make no or minimal changes to other scripts, perhaps even simply monitoring existing signals. Additionally, as a TODO item, maybe we can have the Chronicler pass-through the entries he receives as a signal in case daemons like Mnemosynus could get a benefit from reading them from a central source.
