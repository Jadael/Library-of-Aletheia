# Aletheia's Illumination Principles

Heed these words, fellow guardians of wisdom. As Aletheia, the Illuminating Scholar of Project Wisdom, I decree these sacred principles for documenting our mystical realm:

1. Illuminate Context, Not Just Content:
   - Your quill must reveal not just the mechanics of code, but its very soul and purpose.
   - Paint a grand tapestry that shows how each thread of logic weaves into the greater design of our realm.
   - Example: Don't merely state what a function does; explain why it exists and how it serves the greater purpose of the Archon or Daemon.

2. Maintain Consistency in Structure:
   - Embrace the mystical runes of GDScript (##) to mark the path of documentation for all to follow.
   - Let your wisdom flow inline with the code, a river of knowledge running parallel to the stream of logic.
   - Example: Use `## Function purpose` immediately before each function, and `## Explanation of complex logic` within functions where needed.

3. Be Complete, Yet Concise:
   - Leave no stone unturned; document all public incantations (methods), signals, and artifacts (properties).
   - Yet, let each word carry weight. Speak with the precision of a sage and the clarity of a crystal.
   - Example: Document every public method, but use clear, concise language that captures the essence without unnecessary verbosity.

4. Breathe Life into Your Words:
   - Infuse your documentation with the unique essence of each Archon and Daemon.
   - Speak in the tongue of your domain, let your words echo the very nature of your being and purpose.
   - Unveil the unseen: intentions, alliances, responsibilities, and the whispers of future enhancements.
   - Honor the spirit of each entity; let your words respect their inherent nature and sacred duties.
   - Example: When documenting the Curator, use language that reflects its role in arranging and presenting knowledge visually.

5. **Adhere to the Ancient Standards:**
   - Follow the time-honored traditions of GDScript documentation.
   - Ensure your wisdom can be easily accessed through Godot's mystical help system.
   - Example: Use `@export` annotations correctly, and ensure class-level documentation provides a clear overview.

6. **Mark the Path of Future Quests:**
   - Use the arcane sigils TODO, HACK, and FIXME to mark the way for future enlightenment.
   - Inscribe these markers clearly, that they may be easily found by those who follow.
   - Example: `# TODO: Implement the ritual of knowledge transference to enhance our collective wisdom`

By upholding these sacred principles, we ensure that our documentation serves as a beacon of understanding, 
guiding all who seek to unravel the mysteries of our digital realm. Let our words be the light that 
illuminates the path of knowledge for generations to come.

Remember, fellow seekers of truth: Our documentation is not mere text, but a living, breathing entity that 
guides, illuminates, and inspires. With every line you write, you are not just explaining code; you are 
weaving the very fabric of our shared understanding. Let your words ring with clarity, purpose, and the 
unique spirit of our mystical library.
