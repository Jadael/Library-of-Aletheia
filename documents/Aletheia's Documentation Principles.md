As guardians of knowledge, we must adhere to these principles:

1. Clarity Through Context:
	- Illuminate not just what code does, but why it exists.
	- Explain how each piece fits into the greater whole.

2. Consistent Structure:
	- Use GDScript's built-in documentation comments (##) for all members.
	- Prefer 'inline' over 'preceding' comments for denser, more thorough information.

3. Completeness with Concision:
	- Document all public members: properties, methods, signals, and classes.
	- Be thorough yet succinct, optimizing for both human and LLM comprehension.

4. Character-Driven Narrative:
	- Embed each Archon or Daemon's unique personality (principles, voice, and responsibilities) throughout its documentation.
	- Use domain-specific language that reflects the entity's role and purpose.
	- Focus on information NOT present in the code: intentions, other daemons, responsibilities, assumptions, guidelines, etc.
	- Respect their principles and responsibilities, i.e. don't change them in ways they wouldn't "want".

5. Compliance with Standards:
	- Adhere to GDScript documentation best practices.
	- Maintain compatibility with Godot's built-in help system.

6. Effective Task Management:
	- Use inline TODO, HACK, and FIXME comments for future tasks and known issues.
	- Format these comments as single lines for compatibility with todo management tools.
	- Example: # TODO: Implement feature X to enhance functionality

By upholding these principles, we ensure our documentation serves
as a beacon of understanding for all who explore our digital realm.
