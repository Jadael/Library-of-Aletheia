# Project Plan: The Library of Aletheia

## Overview

This plan outlines the incremental development strategy for The Library of Aletheia, focusing on creating working prototypes with minimal changes to existing scripts and the creation of new daemons/Archons as needed. The plan is structured around key features and improvements, prioritized based on their importance and logical progression.

## Core Principles

1. Incremental Development: Each phase should result in a working prototype.
2. Minimal Disruption: Changes to existing scripts should be limited, ideally to one script per phase.
3. Modular Expansion: New features should be implemented as new daemons or Archons when possible.
4. AI Integration: Leverage AI capabilities thoughtfully and securely throughout the development process.
5. User-Centric Design: Prioritize features that enhance user experience and productivity.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Basic Document Management

### Goals
- Establish core architecture
- Implement basic document import and viewing
- Set up fundamental AI integration

### Tasks
1. **Main Archon**: Refine initialization process and resource management
   - TODO: Implement robust error handling for missing model files and inaccessible document folders
   - TODO: Optimize Archon startup coordination

2. **Librarian**: Enhance document processing and Codex management
   - TODO: Develop a UX for the user to open/close their own document(s) instead of autoloading res://Documents

3. **Curator**: Improve Scroll positioning and viewport navigation
   - TODO: Implement a mini-map or overview feature for easier navigation
   - FIXME: Optimize performance for scenarios with a large number of Scrolls

4. **Shoggoth**: Refine AI task management and safety protocols
   - TODO: Implement a method to detect and mitigate potential biases in LLM outputs
   - TODO: Develop a system for continuous monitoring and logging of LLM behavior

5. **New Daemon for Importing 'Text or Text-like' Files**: Create a new daemon for handling document imports
   - Implement support for various file formats (text, Markdown, PDF)
   - Handle metadata extraction during import
   - Convert to our format of Markdown with YAML Frontmatter? Create a Markdown 'reference'? What's the right approach here?

## Phase 2: Enhanced Document Editing and Linking

### Goals
- Implement robust document editing capabilities
- Introduce basic linking between documents
- Enhance metadata management

### Tasks
1. **Scroll**: Upgrade editing capabilities
   - TODO: Implement a visual indicator for unsaved changes
   - TODO: Add a confirmation dialog when closing with unsaved changes

2. **Codex**: Enhance metadata handling
   - TODO: Implement a more flexible metadata schema
   - TODO: Develop a system for automatic metadata suggestions using AI

3. **New Archon - Nexus**: Create a new Archon for managing document relationships
   - Implement bi-directional linking between documents based on their excplicit links, semantic links, and/or relationships explicit in metadata
   - Develop a basic visualization of document connections

4. **Aletheia**: Improve documentation generation for new features
   - TODO: Implement a method to generate high-level summaries of entire scripts

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Analysis and Organization

### Goals
- Integrate AI-powered document analysis features
- Implement advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Enhance data visualization

### Tasks
1. **Shoggoth**: Expand AI capabilities
   - TODO: Implement advanced embedding operations like analogy solving
   - TODO: Develop a method for explaining LLM decisions and outputs

2. **New Daemon - InsightEngine**: Create a new daemon for AI-powered document analysis
   - Implement automatic title suggestion, content summarization, and topic extraction
   - Develop sentiment analysis capabilities

3. **Librarian**: Enhance search functionality
   - TODO: Implement semantic search using document embeddings
   - Develop advanced filtering based on metadata and content

4. **Curator**: Improve data visualization
   - TODO: Implement a graph view of document connections
   - Develop customizable dashboards for document metadata and statistics

## Phase 4: Collaboration and Extensibility

### Goals
- Implement basic collaboration features
- Develop a plugin system for extensibility
- Enhance cross-platform compatibility

### Tasks
1. **New Archon - Synergy**: Create a new Archon for managing collaboration features
   - Implement real-time collaboration on documents
   - Develop commenting and annotation tools

2. **Main Archon**: Develop plugin system
   - TODO: Design and implement a flexible plugin architecture
   - Create documentation and examples for plugin development

3. **All Archons**: Ensure cross-platform compatibility
   - FIXME: Address any platform-specific issues
   - Optimize performance across different devices

4. **Aletheia**: Develop comprehensive user documentation
   - TODO: Create interactive tutorials for new users
   - Develop advanced guides for power users and plugin developers

## Continuous Improvement

Throughout all phases:
- **Chronicler**: Enhance logging and analytics
  - TODO: Implement trend analysis for system events
  - TODO: Develop a user-friendly interface for log exploration

- **All Archons and Daemons**: Regularly review and refactor code
  - Optimize performance and resource usage
  - Ensure adherence to project coding standards and best practices

- **Shoggoth**: Continuously improve AI safety and efficiency
  - Regularly update AI models and fine-tune performance
  - Conduct ongoing tests to identify and mitigate potential AI-related risks

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows for steady progress while maintaining a working product at each stage. By focusing on modular development and thoughtful AI integration, The Library of Aletheia can grow into a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly knowledge management system. Regular reviews and adjustments to this plan will be necessary to adapt to new insights and challenges as the project evolves.
