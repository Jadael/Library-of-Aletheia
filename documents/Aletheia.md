# Aletheia

## Properties
- @export_multiline var about = """
- @export_dir var scripts_folder: String = "res://Daemons"
- @export_dir var docs_output_folder: String = "res://Daemons/docs/"

## Signals
- signal documentation_generated(num_scripts: int)
- signal script_documentation_updated(script_name: String)

## Functions
### _ready
`func _ready():`

﴾**Function: _ready**
**Context and Purpose:** The `_ready` function is the entry point for the Aletheia script, which is responsible for initializing the script's functionality. Its primary purpose is to summon loyal Daemons and initiate the process of generating project documentation.

**Input(s):** None

**Output returned and/or behavior(s):** The function does not explicitly return any output. Instead, it initiates two key processes:
1. **Summoning Daemons:** The `_summon_daemons()` function is called, which likely loads or instantiates the necessary Daemon assistants.
2. **Generating project documentation:** The `generate_project_documentation()` function is awaited, which begins the process of generating project documentation.

**Intricacies in its implementation:**
* The function uses the `await` keyword to pause its execution until the `generate_project_documentation()` function completes.
* The `_summon_daemons()` function is called first, which suggests that the Daemons are essential for generating project documentation.

﴿

### _summon_daemons
`func _summon_daemons():`

﴾**Function:** `_summon_daemons`
**Context and Purpose:** The `_summon_daemons` function is part of the Aletheia script, which is responsible for managing the lifecycle of various daemons that assist in the documentation ecosystem. This function specifically instantiates and adds three daemons - ScribeScanner, LoreWeaver, and ArchivistLibrarian - as children of Aletheia.

**Inputs:** None

**Output/Behavior:** The function instantiates the three daemons using the `preload` function to ensure the scenes are loaded at compile-time, reducing runtime overhead. It then adds the daemons as children of Aletheia. Additionally, the `ArchivistLibrarian` daemon is configured with the `docs_output_folder` path.

**Intricacies:** The function relies on the `preload` function to load the daemon scenes at compile-time, which can improve performance by reducing the time it takes to load the scenes at runtime. The function also sets up the `ArchivistLibrarian` daemon with the `docs_output_folder` path, which is necessary for the daemon to function correctly.

﴿

### generate_project_documentation
`func generate_project_documentation() -> void:`

﴾Error: After 3 attempts, the cosmic forces failed to reveal the mysteries of function generate_project_documentation﴿

### update_script_documentation
`func update_script_documentation(script_path: String) -> void:`

﴾Aletheia is a script designed to update the documentation for a specific Godot script. Its purpose is to ensure the documentation remains current and accurate, reflecting changes to the script's structure and content.

Function Name: `update_script_documentation`

Input: A `String` representing the path to the script to be updated.

Output: The function does not return a value explicitly, but it achieves the following behaviors:

1. Updates the documentation for the given script by re-parsing its content with the `ScribeScanner`.
2. Emits a signal named `script_documentation_updated` with the name of the updated script as an argument.

Intricacies:

1. The `ScribeScanner` is used to parse the script's content, which is essential for generating accurate documentation.
2. The function assumes that the script's path is valid and can be accessed.
3. The `emit_signal` call is used to notify any connected scripts or nodes that the documentation for the given script has been updated.

The function serves as a crucial part of the Aletheia script, ensuring that documentation remains up-to-date and reflecting changes to the underlying script. This ensures the integrity and accuracy of the documentation, making it a valuable asset for developers and users.

﴿

### get_documentation
`func get_documentation(script_name: String) -> String:`

﴾Documenting the Godot function `get_documentation` from the Aletheia script:

**Function Context and Purpose:** This function acts as an entry point to access the documentation for a given script in the Aletheia script. Its primary purpose is to provide other entities with the necessary information to understand and utilize the script.

**Input(s):** The function expects a `script_ name` parameter, which is a string representing the name of the script without its file extension.

**Output and Behavior:** The function returns a string containing the documentation for the specified script. It delegates the task of retrieving the documentation to the `ArchivistLibrarian`, which is responsible for navigating the sacred paths and methods to access the preserved knowledge.

**Intricacies in Implementation:** The function relies on the `ArchivistLibrarian` to retrieve the documentation, showcasing the importance of proper knowledge management and organization within the Aletheia script. The function serves as a gateway to the collected wisdom, making it easy for other entities to access the knowledge without having to navigate the complexities of the script's internal structure.

﴿

### get_documentation_guidelines
`func get_documentation_guidelines() -> String:`

﴾**Function Name:** get_documentation_guidelines
**Script Purpose:** The Aletheia script is designed to maintain a collective knowledge base, providing documentation guidelines for contributors to follow.
**Function Context and Purpose:** The `get_documentation_guidelines` function is responsible for returning a string containing the sacred tenets of documentation for the Aletheia realm. These principles serve as a guide for contributors to ensure that their documentation practices align with the project's standards.

**Input:** None; the function does not expect any input.

**Output Returned and Behavior:** The function returns a string containing the documentation guidelines, which includes a brief introduction, a list of principles, and a closing statement. The returned string is a static, pre-defined value embedded within the function.

**Intricacies in Implementation:** The function utilizes a multi-line string literal to define the documentation guidelines. This approach allows the guidelines to be easily modified or updated without requiring significant changes to the function's implementation.

**Description End:** ﴿
