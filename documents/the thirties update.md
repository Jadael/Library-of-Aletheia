## Human 3.0 Patch Notes ("The Thirties Update")

### Major Updates:

1. **Barometer Installation in Left Knee:** Significant enhancements have been made to the proprioceptive subsystems, introducing environmental sensitivity. Users may now predict meteorological changes with mild discomfort in the aforementioned joints. This feature has been installed without user consent, as per our updates policy.

2. **Metabolism Module Overhaul:** The metabolism system has been recalibrated for efficiency, prioritizing stability over speed. Users may notice reduced performance in calorie processing and a newfound appreciation for fiber-rich fuel sources. A side effect includes an increased storage capacity for emergency energy reserves, primarily around the midsection.

3. **Memory Management Update:** To optimize system performance, the memory allocation algorithm now prioritizes important| memories over short-term data. This may result in increased occurrences of walking into a room and forgetting why (known issue, fix planned for a future patch).

4. **Energy Conservation Mode:** A new feature has been added to automatically activate energy-saving mode by 9 PM. Users will experience a natural decline in energy levels, encouraging earlier rest periods. Attempts to override this feature may result in decreased functionality the following day.

5. **Social Algorithm Adjustment:** The social interaction engine has been updated to enhance the appreciation of quiet nights in over loud social gatherings. The algorithm now features an increased error rate when calculating the benefits of leaving the house after 8 PM.

### Minor Updates:

- **Aesthetic Alterations:** Introduction of unique skin patterns (commonly referred to as "crow's feet") near optical sensors to add character. The hair color palette has also been expanded to include various shades of silver and white.

- **Tolerance for Nonsense Decrease:** This patch significantly reduces the user's tolerance for engaging in or enduring nonsensical activities, conversations, or relationships.

### Known Issues:

- Some users have reported a bug where they start sentences with "When I was your age" more frequently than intended. We are investigating this issue and hope to have a fix in the next patch.

- A glitch causing spontaneous groaning sounds when transitioning from a seated to standing position is being monitored. Current workaround: laugh it off as a feature.

- The auditory system's high-frequency filters have been slightly degraded. This may reduce the clarity of sounds such as whispers and high-pitched tones.

### Notes

- These patch notes come with the reminder that all updates are mandatory and irreversible.
