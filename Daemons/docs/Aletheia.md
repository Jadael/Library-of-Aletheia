# Aletheia

## Properties
- @export_multiline var about = """
- @export_dir var scripts_folder: String = "res://Daemons"
- @export_dir var docs_output_folder: String = "res://Daemons/docs/"

## Signals
- signal documentation_generated(num_scripts: int)
- signal script_documentation_updated(script_name: String)

## Functions
### _ready
`func _ready():`

﴾**Function Context and Purpose:**
The `_ready` function is the entry point of the Aletheia script, which is responsible for generating project documentation. When the script is initialized, this function is automatically called, initiating the process of summoning Daemon assistants and generating project documentation.

**Input(s):**
None. The function does not expect any inputs.

**Output Returned and/or Behavior(s):**
The function summons Daemon assistants using the `_summon_daemons` function and then awaits the completion of the project documentation generation process using the `generate_project_documentation` function. The output of this function is the generated project documentation.

**Intricacies in Implementation:**
The function is designed to be a central hub for initializing the project documentation generation process. The use of `_summon_daemons` and `generate_project_documentation` suggests that these functions may be responsible for performing specific tasks, such as fetching data and formatting it into documentation. The `await` keyword indicates that the function will pause execution until the `generate_project_documentation` function completes.

﴿

### _summon_daemons
`func _summon_daemons():`

﴾**Function Name:** `_summon_daemons`

**Context and Purpose:** This function is part of the Aletheia script, responsible for instantiating and adding three Daemon assistants: ScribeScanner, LoreWeaver, and ArchivistLibrarian. These Daemons play a crucial role in the documentation ecosystem, aiding Aletheia in various tasks.

**Input(s):** None

**Output Returned and/ or Behavior(s):**

* Instantiates and adds the three Daemon assistants (ScribeScanner, LoreWeaver, and ArchivistLibrarian) as children of Aletheia.
* Sets up the ArchivistLibrarian Daemon with the `docs_output_folder` path.

**Intricacies in Implementation:**

* The function uses `preload` to load the Daemon scenes at compile-time, reducing runtime overhead.
* The Daemons are added as children of Aletheia, allowing for easy management and interaction.

**Description:** The `_summon_daemons` function is responsible for summoning and setting up the Daemon assistants, enabling Aletheia to efficiently manage its documentation ecosystem. By instantiating these Daemons, Aletheia can focus on its core tasks, relying on its assistants to handle various documentation-related tasks. ﴿

### generate_project_documentation
`func generate_project_documentation() -> void:`

﴾Error: After 3 attempts, the cosmic forces failed to reveal the mysteries of function generate_project_documentation﴿

### update_script_documentation
`func update_script_documentation(script_path: String) -> void:`

﴾**Function Purpose and Context:**
The `update_script_documentation` function is part of the Aletheia script, which appears to be responsible for maintaining and updating documentation for various scripts. This specific function aims to update the documentation for a single script, ensuring that the knowledge remains current.

**Expected Input(s):**
The function expects a single input parameter, `script_path`, which is a `String` representing the path to the script file.

**Output and Behavior:**
The function returns `void`, indicating that it does not produce any explicit output. Instead, it performs the following actions:
1. It renews the documentation for the specified script by re-parsing the script using the ScribeScanner.
2. It emits a signal named "script_documentation_updated" with the name of the updated script as an argument.

**Implementation Intricacies:**
The function seems to rely on the ScribeScanner to parse the script and update the documentation. The implementation might involve complex logic and data structures to manage the documentation and ensure its accuracy and relevance.

**Additional Notes:**
The function's purpose is to ensure that the documentation for a script remains up-to-date and reflects any changes made to the script. This process helps maintain the integrity and accuracy of the documentation, allowing users to access reliable and relevant information about the script.

﴿

### get_documentation
`func get_documentation(script_name: String) -> String:`

﴾The Aletheia script is designed to serve as a gateway to a collection of documentation, allowing other entities to access the knowledge stored within. The `get_documentation` function is a crucial part of this script, as it retrieves the specific documentation requested for a given script.

**Function Context and Purpose:**
The `get_documentation` function is designed to retrieve the documentation for a specific script, providing a gateway to the collected wisdom stored within the Aletheia script.

**Input(s):**
The function expects a single input parameter, `script_ name`, which should be the name of the script without its file extension.

**Output Returned and/or Behavior(s):**
The function returns a `String` containing the documentation for the specified script. The documentation is retrieved by delegating the task to the `archivist_librarian`, which knows the sacred paths and methods to access the preserved knowledge.

**Intricacies in Implementation:**
The `get_documentation` function relies on the `archivist_librarian` to retrieve the documentation, making it a crucial component of the Aletheia script. This design allows for the separation of concerns, enabling the Aletheia script to focus on its primary purpose while delegating the task of documentation retrieval to the `archivist_librarian`.

﴿

### get_documentation_guidelines
`func get_documentation_guidelines() -> String:`

﴾**Function Description:**
**get_documentation_guidelines**

**Context and Purpose:** The `get_documentation_guidelines` function is part of the Aletheia script, which aims to establish a set of principles for documenting the project's code and knowledge base. This function returns a string containing the sacred tenets of documentation, serving as a guide for contributors to ensure consistency and clarity in their documentation.

**Input:** The function does not accept any input parameters.

**Output and Behavior:** The function returns a string containing the documentation guidelines in the form of a sacred text. The output is a formatted text that outlines the principles and best practices for documenting the Aletheia project.

**Intricacies:** The function is implemented using a multi-line string literal, which allows it to return a formatted text containing multiple paragraphs and sections. The returned string is a self-documenting piece of code that outlines the importance of proper documentation and the guidelines for achieving it.

**Description End:** ﴿
