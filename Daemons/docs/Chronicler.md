# Chronicler

## Properties
- @export_multiline var about = """

## Constants
- const LOG_FILE_PATH = "res://chronicle.json"

## Functions
### _ready
`func _ready():`

﴾**Function Context and Purpose:**
The `_ready` function is part of the Chronicler script, which aims to record and store information throughout the game's runtime. In this specific function, it initializes the script by loading the accumulated log data from persistent storage, preparing it for further use.

**Input(s):**
The function does not explicitly expect any input parameters.

**Output/Behavior:**
The function loads the log data from persistent storage using the `load_log()` method, effectively initializing the Chronicler script.

**Intricacies:**
The `load_log()` method is not explicitly defined in this code snippet, but it likely retrieves data from a storage medium (e.g., a file or database) and loads it into the script's internal data structures.

**Summary:**
The `_ready` function is the entry point for the Chronicler script, which loads the accumulated log data from persistent storage to enable the script's functionality. It does not accept any input parameters and returns no output.

﴿

### log_event
`func log_event(entity: String, event_type: String, details: Dictionary):`

﴾**Function Context and Purpose:**
The `log_event` function is part of the Chronicler script, responsible for recording and storing events that occur within the game world. This function allows entities (Archons or Daemons) to contribute to the collective memory by providing details about the events they witness or cause.

**Input(s) Expected:**
The function takes three input parameters:
1. `entity` (String): The Archon or Daemon who witnessed or caused the event.
2. `event_type` (String): The nature of the occurrence.
3. `details` (Dictionary): A collection of information providing the context and specifics of the event.

**Output Returned and/or Behavior(s):**
The function does not return any direct output, but rather modifies the `log_data` array by appending a new log entry. This log entry contains the timestamp of the event, the entity responsible, the event type, and the event details.

**Implementation Intricacies:**
The function uses the `Time.get_datetime_dict_from_system()` method to capture the exact moment of the event's occurrence. This method returns a dictionary representing the current system time, which is then used to populate the log entry.

**Conclusion:**
The `log_event` function is a crucial component of the Chronicler script, enabling entities to contribute to the game world's collective memory. Its implementation ensures that event details are accurately recorded and timestamped, providing a comprehensive record of the game's events. ﴿

### load_log
`func load_log():`

﴾**Function Purpose:**
The `load_log` function is part of the Chronicler script, responsible for retrieving and parsing log data stored in a file. This script aims to chronicle events, storing and loading logs for later reference.

**Input(s):**
None

**Output:**
The function returns `log_data` if the parsing is successful or prints an error message if there's an issue.

**Behavior(s):**

1. If the log file exists at the specified `LOG_FILE_PATH`, the function attempts to open and read the file.
2. The contents are then parsed using JSON. If the parsing is successful, the resulting data is stored in `log_data`.
3. If an error occurs during parsing, an error message is printed, including the error code.
4. If the log file does not exist, the function prints a message indicating that a new era of chronicle begins.

**Notes:**

* The `LOG_FILE_PATH` variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the script, holding the path to the log file.
* The `FileAccess` and `JSON` classes are used for reading the file and parsing the contents, respectively.

### save_log
`func save_log():`

﴾Error: After 3 attempts, the cosmic forces failed to reveal the mysteries of function save_log﴿

### query_log
`func query_log(filter_func: Callable) -> Array:`

﴾**Function Name:** query_log
**Script Purpose:** The Chronicler script is responsible for managing and querying the game's log data. This function allows entities to retrieve specific log entries based on a filter function.

**Context and Purpose:** This function is used to filter the log data and return only the relevant entries that match the specified criteria. It is a crucial part of the Chronicler script, enabling entities to access specific information from the game's history.

**Input(s):** The function expects a single input, `filter_func`, which is a callable function. This function takes a log entry as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the entry should be included in the filtered results.

**Output and Behavior(s):** The function returns an array of log entries that match the filter function. The returned array is a filtered subset of the original log data.

**Intricacies:** The function uses the `filter()` method to iterate over the log data and applies the provided filter function to each entry. The filter function is used to determine which entries should be included in the result.

**Description End:** ﴿

### get_recent_events
`func get_recent_events(count: int) -> Array:`

﴾**Function Description:**

The `get_recent_events` function is part of the Chronicler script, which is responsible for managing and retrieving historical events from the game's log data. The function's purpose is to provide a way to access the most recent events in the game's history, allowing players to explore the recent past.

**Inputs:**

* `count`: An integer value specifying the number of recent events to return. If `count` exceeds the recorded history, the function will return all available events.

**Output and Behavior:**

The function returns an array of recent events, which are a slice of the `log_data` array. The slice starts from the end of the array and moves backwards to the specified `count`. If `count` is greater than the length of `log_data`, the function will return the entire `log_data` array.

**Intricacies:**

The `get_recent_events` function is straightforward and efficient, leveraging the built-in `slice` method of the `log_data` array to extract the desired range of events. The function does not require any additional setup or initialization, making it easy to use and integrate into the game's logic.

**Conclusion:**
The `get_recent_events` function is a simple yet effective tool for accessing the most recent events in the game's history. Its ease of use and flexibility make it an essential part of the Chronicler script, allowing players to explore the game's rich narrative and uncover hidden secrets. ﴿

### analyze_trends
`func analyze_trends():`

﴾**Function Documentation:**

**Function Name:** `analyze_trends`
**Script Purpose:** `Chronicler` script is designed to analyze and identify trends in a dataset. The `analyze_trends` function is a placeholder for the actual implementation of trend analysis.

**Function Context and Purpose:** The `analyze_trends` function is called by the `Chronicler` script to identify patterns and trends in the data. This function is expected to analyze the dataset and return the trends or insights discovered.

**Input(s):** The function expects a dataset as input, which can be in the form of a list, array, or any other data structure that can be processed by the function.

**Output Returned and/or Behavior(s):** The function returns the analyzed trends or insights as output. The exact format of the output is not specified, but it is expected to be a meaningful representation of the trends or patterns discovered in the dataset.

**Intricacies in Implementation:** The `analyze_trends` function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented. The implementation will depend on the specific algorithm or method used for trend analysis. The function may require additional inputs, such as parameters for the algorithm or methods for handling missing data.

**Additional Notes:** The `analyze_trends` function is a key part of the `Chronicler` script and is responsible for extracting valuable insights from the dataset. The implementation of this function will have a significant impact on the overall functionality and accuracy of the script.

﴿

### generate_report
`func generate_report():`

﴾**Function Description:**

**Context and Purpose:** The `generate_report` function is part of the `Chronicler` script, designed to generate a comprehensive report from the various threads of the tapestry. This script aims to weave a grand narrative from the collected data.

**Input(s):** The function does not explicitly expect any input, as it is responsible for compiling and presenting the gathered information.

**Output and Behavior:** The function `generate_report` returns no explicit output but rather modifies the game state, presumably updating the tapestry with the newly generated report.

**Implementation Intricacies:** At present, the function only contains a placeholder comment, indicating that the implementation is incomplete. To fully realize the script's purpose, the developer must fill in the `# TODO` section, possibly integrating with other script functions or game mechanics to generate the report.

**Note:** The script's current state is a starting point, and the actual implementation will depend on the specific requirements and design decisions made during the development process.
