## Allows entities to peer into the vast archives of our history
##
## This function extracts events that match a specific inquiry, facilitating
## targeted exploration of the realm's past for analysis or debugging purposes.

## Retrieves the most recent whispers of our realm's history

## Divines patterns from the chaos of our history

# TODO: Implement a method to handle log rotation or archiving to manage log size over time
# TODO: Develop a system for real-time event streaming to support live monitoring and alerting
# TODO: Create a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to explore the log data
# TODO: Implement advanced search capabilities, including full-text search and time-based queries
# FIXME: Enhance error handling and logging for the Chronicler's own operations to ensure reliability

# Note for all Archons and Daemons:
# To inscribe an event into the eternal ledger, call upon the Chronicler thus:
# Chronicler.log_event(self, event_type, details)
#
# Example:
# Chronicler.log_event(self, "codex_summoned", {"codex_id": "12345", "title": "Ancient Wisdom", "context": "User requested via search"})
#
# Remember, every event you log contributes to the rich tapestry of our realm's history.
# Be generous and thoughtful in your logging, capturing not just what happened, but why and in what context.
# Your logs are the breadcrumbs that future explorers will follow to understand our system's behavior.
# When in doubt, log it out - but always be mindful of the balance between comprehensive logging and system performance.
